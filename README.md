I took this course on coursera.org, under the specialization: Full-Stack Web Development with React held by The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. Here is a link to the certificate: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zeweLAT_bda_6Wpu2Es6ABCAflfZ3HG0/view?usp=sharing<br>
This course explores Javascript based front-end application development, and in particular the React library. This course will use JavaScript ES6 for developing React application. I also got an introduction to the use of Reactstrap for Bootstrap 4-based responsive UI design.<br>
During this course I had to submit an assignment every week, for four weeks. At the end of this course, I was able to:<br>
-Be familiar with client-side Javascript application development and the React library<br>
-Implement single page applications in React<br>
-Use various React features including components and forms<br>
-Implement a functional front-end web application using React<br>
-Use Reactstrap for designing responsive React applications<br>
-Use Redux to design the architecture for a React-Redux application<br>
<br>
Week 1: Introduction to React <br>
In this module I get a quick introduction to front-end JavaScript frameworks and libraries, followed by an introduction to React. I also learned about React components and JSX.<br>
Assignment 1: At the end of this assignment, I have completed the following tasks:<br>
-Created a new DishdetailComponent and added it to the React application.<br>
-Updated the view of the DishdetailComponent to display the details of the selected dish using an reactstrap card component.<br>
-Updated the view of the DishdetailComponent to display the list of comments about the dish using the Bootstrap unstyled list component.<br>
<br>
Week 2: React Router and Single Page Applications<br>
In this week, I learned about various component types. I learned about React router and its use in designing single page applications. I also learned about single page applications and use React Router to design single page applications.<br>
Assignment 2: At the end of this assignment, I have completed the following tasks:<br>
-Integrated the AboutComponent given above into the single page application.<br>
-Added a new functional component named "RenderLeader" through the RenderLeader() function to AboutComponent.js that renders the details of a given leader using the reactstrap "Media" component.<br>
-Construct and render the list of leaders in the About Us page using the "RenderLeader" component implemented above.<br>
 <br>
Week 3: React Forms, Flow Architecture and Introduction to Redux<br>
In this module you was introduced to uncontrolled and controlled forms and briefly examine form validation in React applications. I got an overview of the Flux architecture and introduced to Redux as a way of realizing the flux architecture.<br>
Assignment 3: At the end of this assignment, I have completed the following tasks:<br>
-Added a new class component named CommentForm to DishdetailComponent.js.<br>
-Provide a form to enable users to submit their comments.<br>
-Validate the information entered by the users in the form.<br>
 <br>
Week 4: More Redux and Client-Server Communication<br>
In this module I explored Redux further including Redux action, combining reducers, and Redux thunk, client-server communication using Fetch and the REST API. I also learned about testing, building and deploying React applications.<br>
Assignment 4: At the end of this assignment, I have completed the following tasks:<br>
-Introduced new action types and action creators to support the fetching of the leaders information from the server and update the Redux store.<br>
-Updated the Home and the About component to render the information about the leaders using the downloaded data from the server.<br>
-Add simple animations to the About component where the leaders information is displayed.<br>
-Enabled the users to submit feedback through the feedback form by creating a new feedback service that accepts the form data and uses Restangular to record their feedback on the server.<br>
 <br>
Thank you for your time!
